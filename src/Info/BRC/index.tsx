        <H>About BRC</H>
        <P>
          The <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk">Biological Records Centre</a>{' '}
          (BRC), established in 1964, is a national focus in the UK for
          terrestrial and freshwater species recording. BRC works closely with
          the voluntary recording community, principally through support of
          national recording schemes and societies. BRC is supported by the
          Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the Centre for Ecology
          & Hydrology (UKCEH). The work of BRC is a major BRC of the National
          Biodiversity Network (NBN).

        <H>Which app should I use?</H>

        <P>
          You might have noticed that several of
          <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/apps"> BRC apps</a> feature some of the
          same species? We have introduced the BRC Approved logo to signify that
          data from our apps all go to the same place. Therefore, you are free
          to choose which app you use to record a given species. All records
          will be sent to the same place, treated in the same way and will meet
          the established standards required by the Biological Record Centre.
