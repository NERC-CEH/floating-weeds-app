# Floating Weeds App

A mobile application for Citizen Science focusing on reporting the presence of floating weeds such as water hyacinth. The app helps target monitoring and eradication efforts for invasive aquatic plants.

## About

Floating Weeds is a Citizen Science app for reporting the presence of floating weeds such as water hyacinth. The records you send in help to target the monitoring and eradication of these weeds. You will receive feedback on the records you submit; this can help you learn how to recognise the different floating and emergent plants and look for patterns in their appearance.

Your records will help verify and improve the accuracy of satellite derived floating weed maps on the [Floating Weed Manager](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/floating-weed-manager) portal.
